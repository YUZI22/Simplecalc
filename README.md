# Simplecalc
This is a project, in which will be a simple calculator that will be developed. In this project I will try to learn more about python, anyone can contribute to make it better.

If anyone wants to contribute to the code that will make me more than happy. 
I will also be testing stuff as I go along to help my understanding of this. Like how variables work etc.. (remember I'm no expert)
and also please tell me about any issues, it would help.
