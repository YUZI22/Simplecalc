# SimpleCalculator 
## [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/esta/issues)

This is a project, which was created by me (Yusef Aslam) with the help of IntelliRon.

It is centered around the idea that all software should be easy to use, and it should be functional but still
minimal and it has to look pleasing to the eye.

To download, please download using zip on this website, or in the terminal do: 

`"git clone https://github.com/YUZI22/Simplecalc.git"`

and then do:

`"chmod +x SimpleCalc"`

**Features:**
| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `add` | Adds one number to the second |
| `subtract` | Suctracts one number from the second |
| `divide` | Divides two numbers |
| `multiply` | Multiplies two numbers together |
| `power` | Can take the first number to the power of the second |
| `percentage` | A function to get a percentage of two numbers |
| `remainder` | Gets the remainder of the result of dividing two numbers |

## Other Ideas
These are the ideas we have for the future of the simple* line of applications:
- GUI for SimpleCalculator
- Simple Word (A text editor, but with high functionality as a code editor too.)
- Simple Conference (A conference maker, with ability to create powerpoints too.)
- Simple OS (A clean and minimal but still highly functional OS, made to be simple, should be understood easily.)
