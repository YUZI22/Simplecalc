# SimpleCalculator 

**Dependencies:**
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/about/)

This is a project, which was created by me (Yusef Aslam) and IntelliRon (Big thanks).
It is based on Python and I chose it since, when I first started this project
I felt that Python was a good programming language for this. I also learned as I went along
and it is really fun!!

It is centered around the idea that all software should be easy to use, and it should be functional but still
minimal and it has to look pleasing to the eye.

To download, please download using zip on this website, or in the terminal do: 

`"git clone https://github.com/YUZI22/Simplecalc.git"`

and then do *(Applies to Linux, not needed for Windows):*

`"cd Simplecalc && chmod +x simplecalc1.0.14.py && chmod +x simplecalclauncherlinux.sh"`



**Features:**
| Operation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `add` | Adds one number to the second |
| `subtract` | Suctracts one number from the second |
| `divide` | Divides two numbers |
| `multiply` | Multiplies two numbers together |
| `power` | Can take the first number to the power of the second |
| `percentage` | A function to get a percentage of two numbers |
| `remainder` | Gets the remainder of the result of dividing two numbers |

## Current Main Priorities:
Our main priorities at the moment are:
- ~Launchers for Windows and Linux~
- More efficient code, but more functionality
- Adding a GUI to SimpleCalculator
- Streamlined code to run on any hardware, no matter how big the sum is
- SimpleCalculator API, to run in websites etc..

## Other Ideas
These are the ideas we have for the future of the simple* line of applications:
- GUI for SimpleCalculator
- Simple Word (A text editor, but with high functionality as a code editor too.)
- Simple Conference (A conference maker, with ability to create powerpoints too.)
- Simple OS (A clean and minimal but still highly functional OS, made to be simple, should be understood easily.)
