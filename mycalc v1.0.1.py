# to the power of, https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-do-math-in-python-3-with-operators 
# nvm just made it end the script when 2 characters are detected.
# how len works: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-length-len/ reads the contents of a string or variable in len 
# added only 1 character allowed prompt at "select operation" credit: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12955495/raw-input-should-accept-only-single-character
#Thinking of making it so that the user can do: add num + num instead of having to select add etc..
#added the . infront of the 4 at line 26 to change it to a float to accept higher number, and also accept numbers that are decimals (floats).
#indentation is very important had to change the entire piece of code.
#DONE WHILE TRUE has to be at the top to start the questions again: refer to my ques: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58790686/trying-to-make-a-loop-that-stops-on-user-input
# TAG 1 Right now trying to make it so that if the choice is more than 4 it will say invalid input.
# TAG 1 DONE!!!, found out you need to put it right after the (Choice) variable, right now it does not stop the script after the user has done an invalid input.
# TAG 1 Got the method for while from this website: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Conditional_Statements
# Python operands https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/comparison_operators_example.htm
# search what def means and what elif means.
# Used this for the calc code: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/calculator also (Calculator.py has the actual file)
