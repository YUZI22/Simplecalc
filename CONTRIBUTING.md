:thumbsup: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :thumbsup: 

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to SimpleCalculator and its packages, which are hosted in the Simplecalc repository on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Contributing Guidelines:
We expect everyone that contributes to this project to follow the highest possible standards of ethical workflow. The commitment for the highest standards allows for us to be taken more seriously, as this project is serious and we love working on it, but people must follow this code. This also helps us have a good work path which lets us work on code in a more professional way.

**Who Must Follow Our Code?:**
We expect all of the people the contribute to the project to know and follow the Code. Failure to do so can result in
the relevent actions.

**What If I Have a Code-Related Question or Concern?:**
If you have a question or concern regarding code please report it to either me or IntelliRon (Jaron Frerichs).
Remember, we may be busy sometimes writing code etc.., so be patient if we do not respond.

**Before contributing, make sure the code you wrote meets these guidelines:**
- Please review your code before contributing and make sure there is no errors
- Do not rush the pull request, because me or IntelliRon (Jaron Frerichs) may be busy and may not be able to review it until we are free.
- We expect you to behave professionally, as this is a real projects and we do not endorse bad language and behaviour
- Simple Calculator is open to contribution, but making copies and marking as your own is not endorsed.
- Make sure the code you contribute with is useful/more useful than current code, adding non-useful features will get the pull request cancelled.
- Please actively respond to messages we give you about your code. Part of being useful and honest is responsive, we recognize relevent user feedback when we see it, and we do something about it. If something is broken, fix it.
- If you see someone violating any of the rules of this code of conduct, such as forking and marking as your own, any time you feel these rules aren't satisfied, please contact me or (IntelliRon).
