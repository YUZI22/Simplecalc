You can also add multiline comments like these at the start of a script. I would always add these comments, to write things like:
	- name of the program
	- version of the program
	- author(s)
	- (possibly a description of what the program is supposed to do)
	- Date the program was created (idk when you started this so I can't add it myself)
	- Date the program was last edited

(btw fyi if you don't know what "N/A" means: It means "Not Applicable")

Btw: The code I wrote may look a little different in some editors, since I used Notepad++ at the start, and used TAB instead of four spaces
Also. I just added some comments where I fixed errors. You don't always have to do that. Only add comments where necessary (for example to describe what a function does)
